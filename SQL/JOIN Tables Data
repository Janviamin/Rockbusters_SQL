SELECT D.country,
COUNT(customer_id)
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id

The request is for the top 10 countries by customer count. So, we needed to connect the customer table to the country table. The flow to do this is customer > address > city > country. I grouped by
country and then ordered by customer count, limiting to the first 10 data points in descending order.

SELECT C.city, D.country,
COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE D.country IN ( SELECT D.country
FROM customer A
JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10)
GROUP BY C.city, D.country
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10; 


Since we need the top 10 cities from the top 10 countries, which was the first query, I included the first query with the WHERE clause. First, I completed the query with city and count of
customers only but then added in the country as well so it is clear what country each city is in. I grouped by country and city and then customer count in descending order.

SELECT B.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
E.country,
D.city,
SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE (E.country, D.city) IN(
SELECT D.country, C.city
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE D.country IN(
SELECT D.country
FROM customer A
JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10
)
GROUP BY D.country, C.city
ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10
)
GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5;
