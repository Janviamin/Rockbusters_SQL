# Rockbuster Stealth LLC - Data Analysis Project
## Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company, is planning to launch an online video rental service to compete with streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As a data analyst in Rockbuster’s Business Intelligence (BI) department, your role is to analyze the company’s data to answer key business questions and provide data-driven insights for the new service's launch strategy.

This project involves loading Rockbuster’s data into a PostgreSQL database, using SQL to perform analysis, and visualizing insights that will guide strategic decisions for the company’s 2020 roadmap.

## Key Objectives and Business Questions
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has outlined the following key questions:  

Which movies contributed the most and least to revenue?  
What is the average rental duration for all videos?  
Which countries are Rockbuster’s customers based in?  
Where are high lifetime value customers located?  
Do sales figures vary across geographic regions?
